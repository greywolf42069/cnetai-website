# CNetAI Website Content Framework

This document provides the core text and structure for the official CNetAI website. It's designed to be modular, allowing for easy adaptation into different sections of the site (e.g., homepage, features, for developers, about).

---

## Section 1: Homepage / Hero Section

**Headline:** The Future of the Internet is Secure, Intelligent, and Decentralized.

**Sub-headline:** CNetAI is a next-generation decentralized computing layer, built to clean the web. We leverage AI and post-quantum cryptography to create a safer, faster, and more private internet for everyone.

**Primary Call-to-Action (CTA):** Download the CNetAI dApp
**Secondary CTA:** Read the Whitepaper

## Section 2: The CNetAI Vision: "Clean the W3"

**Headline:** A User-Driven Mission to Neutralize Online Threats.

**Body:** The internet is plagued by malware, phishing, and malicious actors. CNetAI flips the script. Our network empowers users to become the first line of defense. By simply running the CNetAI dApp, you contribute to a global, decentralized "Heuristics Database" of internet threats. Your AI-powered virtual assistant passively identifies potential threats, which are then validated by our AI Oracle network.

**Key Pillars:**
1.  **Decentralized Threat Hunting:** Your personal NetAI instance "mines" new threat signatures, making the internet safer for all.
2.  **AI-Powered Validation:** A network of AI Oracles achieves consensus on new threats with lightning speed and precision.
3.  **Quantum-Resistant Security:** Built from the ground up with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM & ML-DSA) to be secure against the threats of tomorrow.
4.  **Incentivized Participation:** Earn Astral Shards (ASC) and collectible Battle Chip NFTs just for helping secure the network.

## Section 3: Core Features

### The NetAI dApp: Your Personal AI Assistant
A powerful, lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA) that acts as your gateway to the CNetAI ecosystem.
*   **AI Virtual Assistant:** An optimized AI (based on GPT-OSS) that runs efficiently on your devices (1-2GB RAM) to help with scheduling, correspondence, and more.
*   **Passive Mining:** Let your assistant "wander" the web during idle time to discover malicious hosts and earn rewards.
*   **Total Privacy:** Your data and activities are protected by default with advanced privacy features.

### The Oracle Network: AI-Driven Consensus
The intelligent core of our security system.
*   **Automated Validation:** New threat submissions are automatically reviewed by a committee of six specialized AI validator instances.
*   **Unprecedented Speed:** A threat is passed for action once a 4/6 consensus is reached, enabling rapid response.
*   **Orbital Stall (Proof of Denied Service):** Once a high-confidence threat is identified, the network initiates a sanctioned, network-wide DDoS to neutralize the malicious host until it can be seized by law enforcement.

### Unbreakable Privacy & Security
Your security and privacy are not optional features; they are the default.
*   **Post-Quantum Ready:** Secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.
*   **Confidential Transactions:** Transaction amounts are hidden using Bulletproofs zero-knowledge proofs.
*   **Untraceable Payments:** Ring signatures and stealth addresses obscure sender and receiver identities, making your financial activity truly private.
*   **I2P Integration:** An optional privacy layer allows you to submit transactions through the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) for maximum anonymity.

### A High-Performance Blockchain Core
Engineered for speed, scalability, and a superior user experience.
*   **Bitcoin-NG Hybrid Consensus:** Combines the security of Proof-of-Stake with high throughput via key blocks and microblocks, enabling thousands of transactions per second.
*   **User-Friendly Aliases:** Register a simple, readable name (like "yourname") to use instead of long, complex wallet addresses.
*   **Advanced Smart Contracts:** Built on a high-performance Rust & BPF engine, enabling complex dApps, NFT gaming, and more.

## Section 4: For Developers

**Headline:** Build the Next Generation of Decentralized Applications.

**Body:** CNetAI provides a robust, secure, and scalable platform for developers. Our architecture, inspired by Solana's BPF framework and written in Rust, is built for performance.

*   **Powerful SDKs:** Get started quickly with our comprehensive SDKs for Rust and JavaScript.
*   **Permanent Data Hosting:** Host your dApp, website, or data permanently on our decentralized relay network. Pay once with ASC based on storage size.
*   **MEV-Enabled Gas System:** Our Ethereum-like gas system allows for transaction prioritization and creates opportunities for Miner Extractable Value.
*   **Production Ready & Audited:** Our codebase has been rigorously tested and audited, with all critical vulnerabilities resolved. Build with confidence on a secure foundation.

## Section 5: Tokenomics: Astral Shards (ASC) & Battle Chips

### Astral Shards (ASC)
ASC is the native currency of the CNetAI network. It's used for:
*   **Gas Fees:** Paying for transactions and smart contract execution.
*   **Staking:** Delegate your ASC to Oracles to participate in network security and earn rewards.
*   **Alias Registration:** Pay for your unique on-chain identity.
*   **Permanent Storage:** Pay to host data forever on the network.

**Public Sale:** 50% of the initial ASC supply is being offered to the public via a **Strategic Perpetual Reverse Dutch Auction**, an innovative mechanism designed to foster fair price discovery and reward early adopters.

### Battle Chips (NFTs)
Earned alongside ASC, Battle Chips are collectible, tradeable NFTs with varying rarities.
*   **Prove Your Contribution:** Show off the rare Battle Chips you've earned through network participation.
*   **Engage in PVP Battles:** Load your chips into a portfolio and battle other users for a chance to win a percentage of their ASC balance.
